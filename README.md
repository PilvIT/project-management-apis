# Project Management APIs

This repository is the backend of our project management software.
The primary features are

- Health Checks which ensure the uptime of your services
- Vulnerability Alerts which is based on GitHub Actions

This is primarily planned  to be used with a [suitable frontend](https://github.com/PilvIT/project-management-frontend).
You can also use the API to display service status in your office info screens.
